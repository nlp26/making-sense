Making sense of frameworks and libs

## Example Code

The `examples` directory contains standalone scripts showing how to use
common machine learning frameworks:

- `simple_nn.py` &ndash; a neural network from scratch using NumPy.
- `pytorch_example.py` &ndash; a basic model built with PyTorch.
- `sklearn_example.py` &ndash; logistic regression using scikit-learn.
- `tensorflow_example.py` &ndash; a Keras model in TensorFlow.
- `huggingface_example.py` &ndash; sentiment analysis with a pretrained
  Hugging Face Transformer.
- `agentic_ai_example.py` &ndash; a minimal agent built with the latest OpenAI
  SDK.

Run any script with `python <script name>` to see it in action.
